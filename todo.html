    <h2>Born a Crime - Chapter 1 and 2 Summary</h2>
    <p>
      In the first two chapters of “Born a Crime”, Trevor Noah talks about his childhood in South Africa during
      apartheid. <br> He talks about his parent’s childhood in South Africa during apartheid. He talks about his
      parents’s relationship,<br> his mother’s strictness, and his experiences navigating life as a mixed-race child in
      a racially segregated society.



    </p>
    <p>
      The issues addressed in “ Born a Crime”, such as racial segregation and discrimination, relate to the history of
      Rwanda, <br> particularly during the period of ethnic division and the Rwandan Genocide. Like South Africa during
      apartheid, <br> Rwanda faced deep-seated ethnic tensions that resulted in tragic consequences, Trevor Noah’s story
      serves as <br> a reminder of the importance of overcoming such divisions and working towards unity and
      reconciliation.
