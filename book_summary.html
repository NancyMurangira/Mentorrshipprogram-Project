    <h1>Born a Crime - Chapter 1 and 2 Summary</h1>
    <h3>
      In the first chapter Trevor Noah was taking about his birth in a time of apartheid in South Africa. <br> Being born to a black mother and a white Swiss father during such a racist regime made his very <br> existence illegal. He goes on to recount his early childhood, and the constant struggles his family <br> faced due to their mixed-race status. They lived in fear of being caught by the authorities, navigating <br> their way through life with the ever-present threat of being punished for something as simple as existing. <br><br> In chapter two, Trevor talked about his early years growing up in Soweto, a township in Johannesburg. <br> He shares anecdotes about his independent mother, Patricia, who worked hard to provide for him despite the <br> limitations placed on her by apartheid. He also explores the complexities of identity and race, as well as the <br>  ways in which he navigated the racial divides of South African society from a young age.



    <h3> 
      The issues addressed in “ Born a Crime”, such as racial segregation and discrimination, relate to the history of Rwanda, <br> particularly  during the period of ethnic division and the Rwandan Genocide. Like South Africa during apartheid,<br> Rwanda faced deep-seated ethnic tensions that resulted in tragic consequences, Trevor Noah’s story  serves as a <br> reminder of the importance of overcoming such divisions and working towards unity and reconciliation.
