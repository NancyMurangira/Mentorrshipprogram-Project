    <h1>Born a Crime - Chapter 1 and 2 Summary</h1>
    <h2>
      In the first two chapters of “Born a Crime”, Trevor Noah talks about his childhood in South Africa <br>  during apartheid. He talks about his parent’s childhood in South Africa during apartheid. He talks <br> about his parents’s relationship, his mother’s strictness, and his experiences navigating life as a <br> mixed-race child in a racially segregated society.

    <h2> 
      The issues addressed in “ Born a Crime”, such as racial segregation and discrimination, relate <br> to the history of Rwanda, particularly during the period of ethnic division and the Rwandan Genocide.<br> Like South Africa during apartheid, Rwanda faced deep-seated ethnic tensions that resulted in tragic consequences, <br>Trevor Noah’s story serves as a reminder of the importance of overcoming such divisions and working towards unity and reconciliation.
