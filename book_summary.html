    <h1>Born a Crime - Chapter 1 and 2 Summary</h1>
    <h3>
      In the first chapter Trevor Noah was taking about his birth in a time of apartheid in South Africa. <br> Being born to a black mother and a white Swiss father during such a racist regime made his very existence illegal. <br> He goes on to recount his early childhood, and the constant struggles his family faced due to their mixed-race status. <br> They lived in fear of being caught by the authorities, navigating their way through life <br> with the ever-present threat of being punished for something as simple as existing. <br> <br> In chapter two, Trevor talked about his early years growing up in Soweto, a township in Johannesburg. <br> He shares anecdotes about his independent mother, Patricia, <br> who worked hard to provide for him despite the limitations placed on her by apartheid. <br> He also explores the complexities of identity and race, <br> as well as the ways in which he navigated the racial divides of South African society from a young age.



    <h3> 
      The issues addressed in “ Born a Crime”, such as racial segregation and discrimination, relate <br> to the history of Rwanda, particularly during the period of ethnic division and the Rwandan Genocide.<br> Like South Africa during apartheid, Rwanda faced deep-seated ethnic tensions that resulted in tragic consequences, <br>Trevor Noah’s story serves as a reminder of the importance of overcoming such divisions and working towards unity and reconciliation.
